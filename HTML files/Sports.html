                    Makram Daboub may be struggling to prepare his Palestinian team for the start of 2026 World Cup
                    qualification but he takes some comfort, for now at least, that his players stuck in Gaza are safe.
                    The national soccer team’s head coach wanted to include Ibrahim Abuimeir, Khaled Al-Nabris, and
                    Ahmed AlKayed in a
                    training camp in Jordan ahead of World Cup qualifying games against Lebanon next Thursday and
                    Australia on Nov. 21. But they were unable to make it out of Gaza because of the Israel-Hamas war,
                    now in its
                    second month.
                    “So far they are fine,” Daboub told The Associated Press. “Many of their relatives have died,
                    however, as a
                    result of the bombing.”
                    Two players from Gaza, Egypt-based Mohamed Saleh and Mahmoud Wadi, are expected to join the
                    Palestinian team in Jordan. Daboub, who is from Tunisia, acknowledged it will be difficult for
                    players to focus
                    on football while many have families in danger.<span class="moreText">
                    “With the death and destruction in Gaza, the players are in a difficult psychological state,” Daboub
                    said.
                    But for Susan Shalabi, the vice-president of the Palestine Football Association, there’s no question
                    that the
                    players and the people want the games to go ahead.
                    “This is a people that wants to be heard and seen by the rest of the world, wants to live normally
                    like everyone
                    else, so people care about their national team,” Shalabi told The AP. “It represents the yearning to
                    be
                    recognized as a free and sovereign nation.”
                    The Palestine Football Association became a full member of FIFA, soccer’s international governing
                    body, in
                    1998 and has had some success at the regional level.
                    Appearing at the World Cup in 2026 would be a dream for a team that has never come close to reaching
                    the
                    finals via the Asian Football Confederation’s qualifying route.
                    There is a little more hope this time as Asia’s automatic qualification allocation has increased
                    from four places
                    in 2022 to eight in 2026, when the tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and
                    Canada.
                    The Palestinian team, which reached a highest FIFA ranking of 73 in 2018, appeared at the Asian Cup
                    in 2015
                    and 2019 and has qualified for the 2023 continental tournament coming up in Qatar.
                    “There is no match that you can win in advance,” Daboub said. “But we have a good chance of reaching
                    the
                    next round of the World Cup qualifiers.”To be among the 18 teams that advances into that next stage
                    of Asian qualifying,
                    the Palestinians need to
                    finish in the top two of a group containing Australia – expected to take first spot – Lebanon and
                    Bangladesh.
                    They’re currently ranked No. 96, eight places higher than Lebanon and 87 above Bangladesh.
                    Palestine had initially been drawn to host Australia to start this round of qualifying, but the
                    game has been
                    shifted to a neutral venue in Kuwait.
                    Preparations have already been interrupted as players were unable to leave to participate in a
                    tournament in
                    Malaysia last month. Now the team is based in Jordan to be sure of being able to travel for games.
                    A win against Lebanon in the United Arab Emirates next week — the game has also been moved from
                    Beirut
                    because of security concerns — would be a huge step toward the next stage.
                    “We will do our best,” Daboub said. “Football is the most popular game in the world. It brings
                    people together.
                    We aspire to achieve good results and qualify to show the Palestinian identity and that this is a
                    people who
                    deserve life and love peace.”

                <div class="post_title">
                    Saudi Arabia will host the final stages of Asia's top club competition for two years, the Asian
                    Football
                    Confederation said Friday, ahead of the country likely hosting the World Cup.
                    The 24-team AFC Champions League Elite will next season replace the existing Champions League, with
                    $12
                    million going to the winning side.
                    The region's top 24 clubs will be divided into two leagues of 12 across East and West and compete
                    home and
                    away for a place in the last 16.<span class="moreText">The eight winners will advance to a Final Stage -- where teams play
                    the quarter-finals,
                    semis and final in a
                    single-leg format -- which will be held in Saudi Arabia for the first two editions in the 2024-25
                    and 2025-26
                    seasons.
                    Saudi Arabia beat off a bid submitted by Iraq's football association "after evaluating the
                    infrastructure and
                    accommodation requirements as well as all other key operational aspects", the AFC said in a
                    statement.
                    Saudi Arabia is the only bidder for the 2034 World Cup.
                    It is already hosting the FIFA Club World Cup later this month, the 2027 Asian Cup and 2034 Asian
                    Games.

                    Saudi Arabia is set to host the 2034 men’s FIFA World Cup after Australia withdrew its interest in
                    hosting the
                    global showpiece just hours before the bid deadline on Tuesday.
                    “We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and – having taken all factors
                    into
                    consideration – we have reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,” Football
                    Australia said
                    in a statement.
                    Instead the Australia football federation has opted to proceed with their bids for the Women’s Asian
                    Cup in
                    2026 and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.
                    Australia’s withdrawal leaves Saudi Arabia as the only confirmed bidder. The Gulf nation announced
                    its bid on<span class="moreText">
                    October 4 immediately following FIFA’s surprise invitation for expressions of interest from only
                    Asia and
                    Oceania for the 2034 tournament.In a press release sent out on Tuesday, FIFA confirmed that Saudi
                    Arabia was the only
                    bidder for the 2034
                    tournament. However, FIFA said that it will still “conduct thorough bidding and evaluation
                    processes” for the
                    2030 and 2034 tournaments, with the hosts set to be confirmed by October.
                    Spain, Portugal and Morocco are due to co-host the 2030 tournament, while Uruguay, Paraguay and
                    Argentina
                    will all stage an opening match each to mark 100 years since the first World Cup took place.
                    FIFA added that it will remain in contact with the bidders to ensure that “complete, comprehensive
                    bids” are
                    received, which will then be evaluated against the “minimum hosting requirements as previously
                    approved by
                    the FIFA Council.”
                    FIFA says the “priority areas” for the bids are infrastructure, services, commercial and
                    sustainability, and
                    human rights.

                <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image4.jpg" alt=" ">
                <div class="post_title">
                    DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Three months after being fired by Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, Christophe Galtier
                    was hired Thursday to coach Qatari champion Al-Duhail.
                    Al-Duhail announced the hiring one day after ending the contract of Hernán Crespo, the former Argentina
                    forward who coached the Doha club to the Qatar Stars League title last season.
                    The club had cited a “deterioration in the team results” under Crespo including a 1-0 home loss to Persepolis
                    of Iran in the Asian Champions League group stage this month.One of Galtier’s first games in charge is against Cristiano
                    Ronaldo’s Al Nassr, the Saudi Arabian club which
                    leads the group after two rounds. That game is in Riyadh on Oct. 24.
                    Galtier was fired by PSG in July after just one season in charge and winning the French league.
                    He is due to stand trial on Dec. 15 in Nice, France, to face allegations he made racist and anti-Muslim
                    comments when he was coach at the city’s soccer club.
                    Al-Duhail did not state the length of Galtier’s contract.

                <h3>Al-Ittihad FIFA Club World Cup hopes dashed by Al-Ahly</h3>
                <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image43.jpg" alt=" ">
                <div class="post_title">
                    Al-Ittihad’s FIFA Club World Cup campaign ended on Friday with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Al-Ahly in their
                    second-round clash in Jeddah.
                    Thousands of the Egyptian side’s supporters were on their feet for much of the 90 minutes at the King
                    Abdullah Sports City stadium, as their team ultimately proved to be too clinical for the reigning Saudi
                    champions to cope with.
                    Al-Ittihad fans might point to Karim Benzema’s missed penalty in the first half as a turning point but the empty
                    seats in the home section of the stadium when the final whistle sounded told their own story.
                    The reward for the African champions is a semi-final showdown with South American champions Fluminense
                    of Brazil on Monday. Al-Ittihad, who defeated Auckland City from New Zealand 3-0 in the first round of the
                    competition on Tuesday, return to league action on Dec. 23 with a home game against Al-Raed.
                    For the first hour on Friday the match hung in the balance, amid an atmosphere worthy of a meeting between
                    the champions of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Given the passionate level of support from the Al-Ahly fans, at times
                    their players must have felt like they were playing at home.
                    The first half was played at a fast pace as both teams looked to get forward, even if they struggled to create
                    clear chances. Romarinho had one of the best early on, from inside the area, forcing a good save from
                    Mohammed El-Shenawy.<span class="moreText">
                    Al-Ahly were awarded a penalty in the 19th minute when Hassan Kadesh handled a long pass while under
                    pressure from two Egyptian attackers. Despite the wall of yellow behind the goal, Ali Maaloul kept his cool and
                    sent the ball straight down the middle past the diving Abdullah Al-Mayouf.
                    Seven minutes before the break, Benzema got sight of goal when a fine cross from Muhannad Al-Shanqiti
                    found him on the left side of the area, but his low shot was straight at El-Shenawy.
                    As Al-Ittihad continued to push for an equalizer they left themselves open to a counterattack and were almost
                    caught out, with Zakaria Al-Hawsawi forced to put the ball behind for a corner.
                    Before it could be taken, however, the referee was called to the monitor to check a possible earlier handball
                    by Mohammed Abdelmonem and, after a review, he awarded a penalty to Al-Ittihad. Up stepped Benzema in
                    front of a wall of red — and green laser beams shining into his eyes — but El-Shenawy went the right way to
                    make a comfortable diving save.Near the end of a dramatic first half, Al-Ahly almost scored a second when Kahraba
                    latched onto a poor passback from Ahmed Hegazi, but Al-Mayouf was there to make the save.
                    Al-Ittihad effectively started the second half with two new full-backs. First, coach Marcelo Gallardo replaced
                    Hawsawi with Ahmed Bamsaud at half time. Then, moments after the restart, right-back Al-Shanqiti seemed
                    to pick up a hamstring injury and Madallah Al-Olayan took over.
                    Within minutes, the two-time Asian champions almost leveled the game. Igor Coronado slipped the ball
                    through to Faisal Al-Ghamdi on the left side of the area, whose low shot squirmed through the legs of ElShenawy but hit
                    the post and rebounded into the grateful arms of the veteran goalkeeper.
                    Instead of 1-1, the score became 2-0 just before the hour mark. Hussein El-Shahat, who was making a record
                    13th appearance at the Club World Cup, had possession of the ball just inside the left corner of the area, made
                    a little room for himself and then curled a delightful shot past the diving Al-Mayouf, sending the Egyptian fans
                    wild.
                    The game was effectively over just two minutes later when Al-Ahly found huge gaps in the Al-Ittihad defense
                    and Kharaba pulled the ball back from the byline for Emam Ashour to roll the ball home. There was a check for
                    a possible foul in the build-up but the goal stood and that was that.
                    Al-Ahly took their foot off the gas at that point, their thoughts no doubt turning to their semi-final, but
                    Anthony Modeste’s last-minute red card for an elbow on Hegazi might come back to haunt the team.
                    Soon after that, Benzema got Al-Ittihad’s consolation as he fired home from close range to claim his sixth Club
                    World Cup goal.
                    The game will live long in the memories of Al-Ahly fans, as will the celebrations that followed. Al-Ittihad now
                    need to regroup and bounce back on the domestic front, with three games coming up in the space of a week
                    before the end of the year.
