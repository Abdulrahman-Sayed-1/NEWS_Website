                <h3>Palestinian soccer team prepares for World Cup qualifying games against a backdrop of war</h3>

                    Makram Daboub may be struggling to prepare his Palestinian team for the start of 2026 World Cup
                    qualification but he takes some comfort, for now at least, that his players stuck in Gaza are safe.
                    The national soccer team’s head coach wanted to include Ibrahim Abuimeir, Khaled Al-Nabris, and
                    Ahmed AlKayed in a
                    training camp in Jordan ahead of World Cup qualifying games against Lebanon next Thursday and
                    Australia on Nov. 21. But they were unable to make it out of Gaza because of the Israel-Hamas war,
                    now in its
                    second month.
                    “So far they are fine,” Daboub told The Associated Press. “Many of their relatives have died,
                    however, as a
                    result of the bombing.”
                    Two players from Gaza, Egypt-based Mohamed Saleh and Mahmoud Wadi, are expected to join the
                    Palestinian team in Jordan. Daboub, who is from Tunisia, acknowledged it will be difficult for
                    players to focus
                    on football while many have families in danger.<span class="moreText">
                    “With the death and destruction in Gaza, the players are in a difficult psychological state,” Daboub
                    said.
                    But for Susan Shalabi, the vice-president of the Palestine Football Association, there’s no question
                    that the
                    players and the people want the games to go ahead.
                    “This is a people that wants to be heard and seen by the rest of the world, wants to live normally
                    like everyone
                    else, so people care about their national team,” Shalabi told The AP. “It represents the yearning to
                    be
                    recognized as a free and sovereign nation.”
                    The Palestine Football Association became a full member of FIFA, soccer’s international governing
                    body, in
                    1998 and has had some success at the regional level.
                    Appearing at the World Cup in 2026 would be a dream for a team that has never come close to reaching
                    the
                    finals via the Asian Football Confederation’s qualifying route.
                    There is a little more hope this time as Asia’s automatic qualification allocation has increased
                    from four places
                    in 2022 to eight in 2026, when the tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and
                    Canada.
                    The Palestinian team, which reached a highest FIFA ranking of 73 in 2018, appeared at the Asian Cup
                    in 2015
                    and 2019 and has qualified for the 2023 continental tournament coming up in Qatar.
                    “There is no match that you can win in advance,” Daboub said. “But we have a good chance of reaching
                    the
                    next round of the World Cup qualifiers.”To be among the 18 teams that advances into that next stage
                    of Asian qualifying,
                    the Palestinians need to
                    finish in the top two of a group containing Australia – expected to take first spot – Lebanon and
                    Bangladesh.
                    They’re currently ranked No. 96, eight places higher than Lebanon and 87 above Bangladesh.
                    Palestine had initially been drawn to host Australia to start this round of qualifying, but the
                    game has been
                    shifted to a neutral venue in Kuwait.
                    Preparations have already been interrupted as players were unable to leave to participate in a
                    tournament in
                    Malaysia last month. Now the team is based in Jordan to be sure of being able to travel for games.
                    A win against Lebanon in the United Arab Emirates next week — the game has also been moved from
                    Beirut
                    because of security concerns — would be a huge step toward the next stage.
                    “We will do our best,” Daboub said. “Football is the most popular game in the world. It brings
                    people together.
                    We aspire to achieve good results and qualify to show the Palestinian identity and that this is a
                    people who
                    deserve life and love peace.”

                <div class="Text">
                    Saudi Arabia will host the final stages of Asia's top club competition for two years, the Asian
                    Football
                    Confederation said Friday, ahead of the country likely hosting the World Cup.
                    The 24-team AFC Champions League Elite will next season replace the existing Champions League, with
                    $12
                    million going to the winning side.
                    The region's top 24 clubs will be divided into two leagues of 12 across East and West and compete
                    home and
                    away for a place in the last 16.<span class="moreText">The eight winners will advance to a Final Stage -- where teams play
                    the quarter-finals,
                    semis and final in a
                    single-leg format -- which will be held in Saudi Arabia for the first two editions in the 2024-25
                    and 2025-26
                    seasons.
                    Saudi Arabia beat off a bid submitted by Iraq's football association "after evaluating the
                    infrastructure and
                    accommodation requirements as well as all other key operational aspects", the AFC said in a
                    statement.
                    Saudi Arabia is the only bidder for the 2034 World Cup.
                    It is already hosting the FIFA Club World Cup later this month, the 2027 Asian Cup and 2034 Asian
                    Games.

                    Saudi Arabia is set to host the 2034 men’s FIFA World Cup after Australia withdrew its interest in
                    hosting the
                    global showpiece just hours before the bid deadline on Tuesday.
                    “We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and – having taken all factors
                    into
                    consideration – we have reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,” Football
                    Australia said
                    in a statement.
                    Instead the Australia football federation has opted to proceed with their bids for the Women’s Asian
                    Cup in
                    2026 and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.
                    Australia’s withdrawal leaves Saudi Arabia as the only confirmed bidder. The Gulf nation announced

                    Arabia was the only
                    bidder for the 2034
                    tournament. However, FIFA said that it will still “conduct thorough bidding and evaluation
                    processes” for the
                    2030 and 2034 tournaments, with the hosts set to be confirmed by October.
                    Spain, Portugal and Morocco are due to co-host the 2030 tournament, while Uruguay, Paraguay and
                    Argentina
                    will all stage an opening match each to mark 100 years since the first World Cup took place.
                    FIFA added that it will remain in contact with the bidders to ensure that “complete, comprehensive
                    bids” are
                    received, which will then be evaluated against the “minimum hosting requirements as previously
                    approved by
                    the FIFA Council.”
                    FIFA says the “priority areas” for the bids are infrastructure, services, commercial and
                    sustainability, and
                    human rights.

                    DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Three months after being fired by Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, Christophe Galtier
                    was hired Thursday to coach Qatari champion Al-Duhail.
                    Al-Duhail announced the hiring one day after ending the contract of Hernán Crespo, the former Argentina
                    forward who coached the Doha club to the Qatar Stars League title last season.
                    The club had cited a “deterioration in the team results” under Crespo including a 1-0 home loss to Persepolis
                    of Iran in the Asian Champions League group stage this month.One of Galtier’s first games in charge is against Cristiano
                    Ronaldo’s Al Nassr, the Saudi Arabian club which
                    leads the group after two rounds. That game is in Riyadh on Oct. 24.
                    Galtier was fired by PSG in July after just one season in charge and winning the French league.
                    He is due to stand trial on Dec. 15 in Nice, France, to face allegations he made racist and anti-Muslim
                    comments when he was coach at the city’s soccer club.
                    Al-Duhail did not state the length of Galtier’s contract.
