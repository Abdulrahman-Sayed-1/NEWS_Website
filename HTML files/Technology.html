                <div class="post_title">
                    President Abdel Fattah El Sisi gave directives to enhance the use of the state-of-the-art technology
                    in the
                    litigation system nationwide, said Presidential Spokesperson Ahmed Fahmy in a statement on Monday.
                    The President added that the usage of this technology would help regulate and govern all components
                    of the
                    system and contributing to the achievement of equitable and swift justice, Fahmy continued.The
                    President’s directives
                    came during a meeting with Minister of Justice Omar Marwan.
                    The meeting also followed-up on the main aspects were presented, including the expansion of the
                    application
                    of artificial intelligence techniques to convert speech into written text during judicial hearings.<span class="moreText">
                    The minister presented the latest ongoing efforts to prepare and draft the new package of family
                    laws,
                    particularly the personal status bill for Muslims and Christians, as well as the draft law
                    establishing and
                    organizing the Egyptian Family Support Fund.
                    Regarding this matter, the President gave directives to conduct a broad and in-depth community
                    dialogue on
                    draft laws to be finalized, listening with interest and seriousness to all voices, and accommodating
                    various
                    concerns and views that would achieve the laws' objectives of safeguarding rights, protecting

                <h3>Dubai says flying taxis to take off by 2026 from 4 stations across city</h3>
                <img src="../News images/3675776-1156027803.jpg" alt="" class="post_img">
                <div class="post_title">
                    DUBAI: Dubai again is planning for the takeoff of flying taxis in this futuristic city-state,
                    offering its firmest
                    details yet Monday for a pledged launch by 2026.
                    Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced the relaunched flying taxi program
                    on
                    Twitter Sunday, saying air taxis will begin flying in Dubai within three years.
                    Sheikh Mohammed revealed that he had approved designs for air taxi stations at the World Government
                    Summit in Dubai this week.
                    “From the World Government Summit, we approved today the design of the new air taxi stations in
                    Dubai,
                    which will start operating within three years,” Sheikh Mohammed tweeted.
                    The announcment also included the city plans for four “vertiports” by Dubai International Airport,
                    downtown
                    Dubai, Palm Jumeirah archipelago and Dubai Marina. Those points will include two launching pads and
                    four
                    charging points for the flying taxis.<span class="moreText">
                    “We believe those are attractive areas with business hubs and tourist hubs that could generate
                    considerable
                    demand,” Bahrozyan said.
                    The pricing for the flying taxis “will be in the range of a limousine service in Dubai, maybe
                    slightly higher,”
                    Bahrozyan said. The RTA describes limo services rates as “at least 30 percent higher than taxi
                    fares” in the city.
                    Taxis have a minimum fare of around $3.25 and charge $0.50 a kilometer.
                    The Joby prototype can fly over 240 kilometers before needing a charge — something which would put
                    Abu
                    Dhabi and other areas of the country within range. It takes off and lands vertically, while its
                    rotors tilt forward
                    in flight. It has a maximum speed of 320 kph.
                    Joby Avation Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was at $4.20 a share before
                    trading
                    Monday. Its major shareholders include Intel Corp., while Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines also has
                    invested.
                    Opening the skies to flying taxis would contribute to easing the daily traffic that’s only worsening
                    as city

                    RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s technology prowess in artificial intelligence and data management has been
                    recognized as a benchmark for process excellence worldwide, with its nodal agency achieving the
                    highest level
                    of maturity in software development, reported the Saudi Press Agency.
                    Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority, represented by the National Information Center,
                    has achieved
                    the most advanced process capability, becoming the first agency in the Gulf Cooperation Council to
                    be
                    awarded the CMMI Level 5 certification.
                    CMMI stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration, a process level improvement training and
                    appraisal
                    program, and Level 5 is the highest level of maturity within the model.
                    According to the SPA report, the CMMI Institute, which specializes in software engineering,
                    evaluated the
                    software development life cycle of the National Information Center and awarded it the highest honor.<span class="moreText">
                    The CMMI Institute was formally established in 2012 and later acquired in 2016 by the global
                    nonprofit
                    organization ISACA, previously known as Information Systems Audit and Control Association.
                    Positioning Saudi Arabia as a global leader in advanced technologies like artificial intelligence
                    and software
                    development is a key agenda of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030.
                    In 2022, Mishari Al-Mishari, the deputy director of SDAIA, told Arab News that the agency aims to
                    create a
                    leading data and AI-driven economy and make Saudi Arabia one of the top countries in technology.
                    “Data is the new oil, and that’s our perception and belief of how much we could make out of data,”
                    said AlMishari.
                    Earlier in May, Google’s vice president for global public affairs and public policy, Karan Bhatia,
                    said that Saudi
                    Arabia could provide the right environment for businesses and economies to maximize the potential of
                    AI.“The Kingdom is
                    well-positioned to leverage AI with its young, educated population and a strong commitment
                    to innovation. It is important to establish the right environment, policies and skills for AI so
                    that people,
                    businesses and communities in Saudi Arabia can benefit from AI,” said Bhatia.
                    In April, a report by Stanford University revealed that the Kingdom ranks second globally for
                    societal
                    awareness of artificial intelligence. The survey covered several areas, the most important being the
                    extent of
                    “society’s knowledge of the benefits and value of AI products and services.

                    RIYADH: National and international experts are set to congregate in Riyadh to discuss key
                    developments and
                    future trends in the information and communication technology sector amid Saudi Arabia’s push to
                    promote
                    digital transformation.
                    Saudi Arabia’s Communications, Space and Technology Commission, in association with the
                    International Data
                    Corporation will host the ICT Indicators Forum in the capital on March 8.
                    The ninth edition of this forum, which will take place at Four Seasons Hotel, comes at a time when
                    Saudi
                    Arabia is steadily diversifying its economy in line with the goals outlined in Vision 2030.
                    “The Saudi government has been at the forefront of embedding digital transformation initiatives into
                    its
                    transformation journey and the results are there for all to see,” said Hamza Naqshbandi, IDC’s
                    associate vice
                    president for Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, in a press statement.<span class="moreText">
                    As the execution phase of Vision 2030 approaches, he said the impetus on revamping and implementing
                    digital strategies will be a key priority for Saudi organizations.
                    The forum is also expected to examine the progress made in enhancing the efficiency of Saudi
                    Arabia’s digital
                    infrastructure and reaffirm the vitality of scaling digital businesses to support the Kingdom’s
                    digital economy
                    aspirations.
                    He added: “For the last eight years, IDC Directions has provided an essential platform for
                    executives from
                    across the ICT ecosystem to converge and discover IDC’s outlook and predictions for the Kingdom’s
                    technology
                    markets. It is our pleasure to collaborate with CST once again as we showcase the true value of
                    effective
                    public-private partnerships.”
                    In line with its Vision 2030 goals, Saudi Arabia is steadily moving ahead in the information and
                    communication
                    technology sector.
                    According to the figures released by the CST Commission, the Kingdom’s ICT market hit SR154 billion
                    ($40.9
                    billion) in 2022.
                    During 2022, Saudi Arabia witnessed several developments that boosted its ICT sector. This includes
                    the
                    registration of 600 firms in the first global spectrum auction aimed at covering the airspace with
                    Internet
                    services, with the size of investment opportunities forecasted to stand at SR1 billion.Additionally,
                    as a result of the
                    commission’s regulatory reforms, the number of ICT firms aiming to be listed in
                    the financial market hit 11, reflecting a growth rate of 350 percent when compared to 2021

                    PARIS: An Emirati ruling family member has called on tech firms and governments to include more
                    women in
                    policymaking to maximize the benefits and limit the dangers of new technology.
                    Sheikha Bodour Al-Qasimi, President of Sharjah Research, Technology and Innovation Park, told the
                    2nd
                    Women in Tech Global Summit in Paris that offering leadership opportunities to women and including
                    their
                    perspectives in decision and policy-making would have a positive effect.
                    “Things need to change and change fast. We need to take the reins,” she said. “When you consider
                    that even
                    today, government decision-making, policy frameworks, and regulatory parameters are still dominated
                    by
                    men, we need a call to action.”
                    She addressed more than 400 international delegates from business, government, civil society, and
                    the arts at
                    the annual Summit, which aims to create a more inclusive, sustainable, and innovative STEM
                    ecosystem.<span class="moreText">
                    Al-Qasimi shared UN Women data showing that women remain severely underrepresented at all levels of
                    decision-making and across political life in general.
                    “According to UNESCO, 57 percent of STEM graduates in the Arab world are women, with this number
                    rising
                    to 61 percent in my country, the UAE,” said Al-Qasimi.
                    The publishing entrepreneur and philanthropist described women as creators of social fabric who, if
                    empowered to be more influential in decision-making, would deliver policies that unlock the benefits
                    of new
                    technologies while managing their potential harms to communities.
                    “Today we need to ensure that gender parity is guaranteed and not just a target,” said Al-Qasimi.

                    MAKKAH: The Center of Digital Entrepreneurship unveiled a new competition, Ma’amel Code, this week
                    to
                    empower Saudi university students and promote a new wave of digital entrepreneurship.An initiative
                    of the Ministry of
                    Communications and Information Technology, the competition seeks to
                    transform innovative digital ideas into promising startups, fostering the growth of a digital
                    generation.
                    Yousef Abu Bakar, director of the digital innovation program at the ministry, said that CODE was
                    dedicated to
                    supporting and empowering entrepreneurs and emerging tech companies.
                    “Operating through its branches in various Saudi universities, CODE has set up six laboratories
                    across the
                    Kingdom, including those at Princess Nourah University, King Saud University, Qassim University, Dar
                    AlHekma University,
                    King Khalid University, and King Faisal University,” Abu Bakar said.
                    These laboratories have highly skilled teams with strong technical acumen, offering extensive
                    support to both
                    university-based and external projects and startups.<span class="moreText">
                    The Ma’amel Code competition stands as a flagship initiative among the array of programs introduced
                    by
                    CODE.
                    It is tailored to encourage student-led projects. The process is straightforward — teams of students
                    from each
                    university can visit the competition page, accompanied by a technical expert, to present their
                    innovative ideas.
                    A rigorous evaluation process is used to shortlist the most promising ideas. Once accepted, students
                    undergo
                    a brief training program designed to enhance competitive spirit and facilitate interaction among
                    universities
                    and the laboratories.
                    Winners will be awarded financial prizes and granted access to a variety of services offered by the
                    laboratories, enabling them to realize their entrepreneurial visions.
                    The atmosphere in all CODE branches is brimming with tech companies, projects and aspiring
                    individuals eager
                    to tap into the wide range of services.
                    CODE’s involvement in the “Tech Growth” program positions it as an executive partner focused on
                    supporting
                    tech companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in their market expansion efforts.
                    The partnership provides various support programs, including the MVP Lab initiative. Through this
                    program,
                    incubated companies receive non-refundable support amounting to SR150,000 ($40,000) aimed at fueling
                    the
                    development of tech business models and diverse tech solutions.
                    Abu Bakar said that the Ma’amel Code competition was just the beginning as three more events were in
                    the
                    pipeline.
                    These forthcoming events will be announced later, each in collaboration with different partners and
                    technologies, further igniting competition among university students and the valued partners of
                    CODE.

                    startup companies” operating in the sectors of technology, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and
                    sustainable
                    management of resources on the sidelines of UAE’s World Government Summit held in Dubai.
                    The attendees expressed interest in investing in Egypt, and those already having investments in the
                    country,
                    said they wanted to expand. In that context, the president showcased the government's eagerness for

                    them.

                    modern technology,
                    and sustainable development. He also shed light on the economic, institutional, and legal reforms
                    Egypt had
                    carried out, as well as the facts that Egypt is turning into a regional energy hub, and that the
                    country is a large
                    market.
                    The president had met with UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashed Al
