                <h3>Gaza: Arab countries unwilling to assume future control</h3>    
                <div class="post_title">
                    <h4>Why are Arab states reluctant to play a part in the political future of the Gaza Strip after the current
                    conflict quiets?</h4>
                    Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi did not mince his words during the Manama Dialogue of the
                    International Institute for Strategic Studies.
                    "All of us have to speak loud and clear about the catastrophe that the Israeli war is bringing, not just on Gaza,
                    but on the region in general," he said in Bahrain in mid-November.
                    Safadi's words highlight that even those Arab states that have diplomatically recognized Israel are currently
                    distancing themselves from its military response to the Hamas terror attack on October 7. Hamas is classified
                    as a terrorist organization in Germany, the European Union, the US and elsewhere.
                    The solidarity that Arabs feel for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip — especially in view of the high and rising
                    death toll — outweighs this far-reaching classification.

                <div class="post_title">
                    However, Arab states have also made it clear they are unwilling to play a part in establishing a new political
                    order in the Gaza Strip after the end of the war, which is not yet foreseeable.
                    Arab states are not prepared to let Israel have its way and then "come and clean the mess after Israel," stressed
                    Safadi.
                    Representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have expressed similar views.
                    One factor in their reluctance is the question of security, and whether Israel will really succeed in destroying
                    Hamas and rendering it harmless.

                    Accepting political or even military responsibility in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas structures, or at least sympathy for
                    the
                    terrorist organization could possibly persist, would put Arab countries in an extremely delicate situation.
                    Jordan's foreign minister therefore does not see the responsibility for the Palestinian territory's political future
                    with
                    Jordan or other Arab nations."Let me be very clear," said Ayman Safadi, "there will be no Arab troops going to Gaza.
                    None. We're not going to be seen
                    as the enemy.

                <h3>Biden administration privately warned by American diplomats of growing
                fury against US in Arab world</h3>
                <div class="Text">
                CNN — The Biden administration has received stark warnings from American diplomats in the Arab
                world that its strong support for Israel’s destructive and deadly military campaign in Gaza “is losing us
                Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN.
                The cable underscores profound concern among American officials about the growing anger against the
                United States that erupted soon after Israel launched its operations against Hamas, following the militant
                group’s attacks in Israel on October 7 that left over 1,400 Israelis dead.
                “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” reads a Wednesday cable from the US Embassy in
                Oman, citing conversations with “a wide range of trusted and sober-minded contacts.”<span class="moreText">
                The robust US support for Israel’s actions is being seen, the cable warns, “as material and moral
                culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.”
                The cable from the embassy was written by the second-highest US official in Muscat and sent to, among
                others, the White House’s National Security Council, the CIA and the FBI. While it’s just one cable from
                a regional embassy, it provides a private snapshot of the alarm over the growing anti-US wave sweeping
                the Middle East.
                Another cable obtained by CNN from the American embassy in Cairo relayed back to Washington, as
                part of a daily media summary, the commentary in a state-run Egyptian newspaper that “President
                Biden’s cruelty and disregard for Palestinians exceeded all previous US presidents.

                <div class="Text">
                    CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.
                    President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of
                    Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the
                    administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza
                    and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow
                    civilians to flee away from the fighting.
                    In recent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis
                    in Gaza.
                    Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign
                    minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi
                    Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
                    At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US
                    opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel.<span class="moreText">The White House said
                    Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of
                    military operations in areas of Northern Gaza.
                    Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though
                    Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US
                    officials told CNN. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials
                    noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before
                    deciding to allow it.
                    Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as
                    progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it
                    can build on.
                    Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel.
                    CNN previously reported that some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military
                    operations they simply cannot stomach defending; calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing
                    among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian
                    civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes.
                    Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically.
                    The president was confronted by a protester calling for a ceasefire at a private fundraiser last week; proPalestinian
                    protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one
                    of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and
                    words like “genocide Joe.”
