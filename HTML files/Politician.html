                <h3>Gaza: Arab countries unwilling to assume future control</h3>
                <div class="post_title">
                    <h4>Why are Arab states reluctant to play a part in the political future of the Gaza Strip after the
                        current
                        conflict quiets?</h4>
                    Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi did not mince his words during the Manama Dialogue of the
                    International Institute for Strategic Studies.
                    "All of us have to speak loud and clear about the catastrophe that the Israeli war is bringing, not
                    just on Gaza,
                    but on the region in general," he said in Bahrain in mid-November.
                    Safadi's words highlight that even those Arab states that have diplomatically recognized Israel are
                    currently
                    distancing themselves from its military response to the Hamas terror attack on October 7. Hamas is
                    classified
                    as a terrorist organization in Germany, the European Union, the US and elsewhere.
                    The solidarity that Arabs feel for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip — especially in view of the
                    high and rising
                    death toll — outweighs this far-reaching classification.

                <h3>Focus on Palestinian plight</h3>
                <div class="post_title">
                    However, Arab states have also made it clear they are unwilling to play a part in establishing a new
                    political
                    order in the Gaza Strip after the end of the war, which is not yet foreseeable.
                    Arab states are not prepared to let Israel have its way and then "come and clean the mess after
                    Israel," stressed
                    Safadi.
                    Representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have expressed similar views.
                    One factor in their reluctance is the question of security, and whether Israel will really succeed
                    in destroying
                    Hamas and rendering it harmless.

                    Accepting political or even military responsibility in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas structures, or at
                    least sympathy for
                    the
                    terrorist organization could possibly persist, would put Arab countries in an extremely delicate
                    situation.
                    Jordan's foreign minister therefore does not see the responsibility for the Palestinian territory's
                    political future
                    with
                    Jordan or other Arab nations."Let me be very clear," said Ayman Safadi, "there will be no Arab
                    troops going to Gaza.
                    None. We're not going to be seen
                    as the enemy.

                <h3>Biden administration privately warned by American diplomats of growing
                    fury against US in Arab world</h3>
                <div class="post_title">
                    CNN — The Biden administration has received stark warnings from American diplomats in the Arab
                    world that its strong support for Israel’s destructive and deadly military campaign in Gaza “is
                    losing us
                    Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN.
                    The cable underscores profound concern among American officials about the growing anger against the
                    United States that erupted soon after Israel launched its operations against Hamas, following the
                    militant
                    group’s attacks in Israel on October 7 that left over 1,400 Israelis dead.
                    “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” reads a Wednesday cable from the US Embassy in
                    Oman, citing conversations with “a wide range of trusted and sober-minded contacts.”<span
                        class="moreText">
                        The robust US support for Israel’s actions is being seen, the cable warns, “as material and
                        moral
                        culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.”
                        The cable from the embassy was written by the second-highest US official in Muscat and sent to,
                        among
                        others, the White House’s National Security Council, the CIA and the FBI. While it’s just one
                        cable from

                    CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.
                    President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of
                    Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the
                    administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into
                    Gaza
                    and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow
                    civilians to flee away from the fighting.
                    In recent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian
                    crisis
                    in Gaza.
                    Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign
                    minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and
                    Saudi
                    Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
                    At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated
                    US
                    opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on
                    Israel.<span class="moreText">The White House said
                        Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of
                        military operations in areas of Northern Gaza.
                        Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even
                        though
                        Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US
                        officials told CNN. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and
                        the officials
                        noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza
                        before
                        deciding to allow it.
                        Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement
                        as
                        progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US
                        believes it
                        can build on.
                        Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel.
                        CNN previously reported that some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s
                        military
                        operations they simply cannot stomach defending; calls for the US to back a ceasefire are
                        growing
                        among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian
                        civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes.
                        Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically.
                        The president was confronted by a protester calling for a ceasefire at a private fundraiser last
                        week; proPalestinian
                        protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one
                        of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood
                        – and
                        words like “genocide Joe.”

                    Ramallah, November 7, 2023—Israeli forces have killed twice as many Palestinian children in Gaza
                    over the
                    past month than the total number of Palestinian children killed in the West Bank and Gaza combined
                    since
                    1967.
                    Israeli forces have killed at least 4,237 Palestinian children in Gaza in one month since the
                    Israeli military
                    unleashed a massive military offensive on the Gaza Strip on October 7, according to the Palestinian
                    Ministry of
                    Health in Gaza. There are an additional 1,350 children missing under the rubble of destroyed
                    buildings, most of
                    whom are presumed dead, meaning that over 5,500 Palestinian children have been killed in Gaza over
                    the past
                    30 days, at a rate of over 180 children per day.
                    Between September 2000 and October 6, 2023, DCIP independently verified that Israeli forces and
                    settlers
                    killed 2,187 Palestinian children throughout the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and
                    the Gaza
                    Strip.<span class="moreText"> Israeli forces killed at least 281 Palestinian children between December 9, 1987 and
                    September 28, 2000,
                    according to B’Tselem. Palestinian estimates suggest Israeli forces killed no more than 100
                    Palestinian children
                    between June 1967, when Israeli forces occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the
                    Gaza Strip,
                    and December
                    1987.
                    “Israeli forces are killing Palestinian children at a shocking rate as world leaders actively show,
                    day after day,
                    that they lack the temerity to force an end to the bombardment, the bare minimum humanitarian
                    response,” said
                    Ayed Abu Eqtaish, accountability program director at DCIP. “For decades, the international community
                    has
                    supported and justified Israeli war crimes and the denial of the Palestinian people’s right to
                    self-determination,
                    prioritizing the security of the Israeli people at the expense of Palestinian life. Palestinian
                    children are bearing
                    the brunt of that complicity and the failure of international law, protection, and accountability
                    mechanisms.”
                    The death toll is expected to rise dramatically as Israeli authorities cut off Palestinians in Gaza
                    from food,
                    water, electricity, medical supplies, and fuel and Israeli forces continue indiscriminate and direct
                    attacks against
                    residential buildings and civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, bakeries, solar
                    panels, water stations,
                    and agricultural land.

                <h3>Tunisia launches national consultation on reforms</h3>
                <img class="post_img" src="../images file/image20.jpg" alt="">
                <div class="post_title">
                    TUNIS: Tunisia on Saturday launched a wide-ranging national consultation that will feed into
                    drafting a new
                    constitution, the North African country’s technology ministry said.
                    Part of a reform package pushed by President Kais Saied, who is seeking to bolster his authority,
                    the exercise calls on
                    citizens to send in suggestions and will last until March 20.
                    Eligible topics include electoral, economic, financial, social, developmental, health, education and
                    cultural affairs.
                    The constitutional referendum is planned for July 25, 2022 — exactly a year after Saied sacked the
                    government, suspended
                    parliament and seized wide-ranging powers.
                    His power grab was initially supported by many Tunisians, amid frustration surrounding repeated
                    deadlocks within the
                    fractious legislature in recent years.
                    The president later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with
                    reforms to the political
                    system.<span class="moreText">
                    The consultation — dubbed “Your opinion, our decision” — is initially targeting youth centers
                    through an electronic
                    platform across the country’s 24 regions, the technology ministry said.
                    “The platform will be open to everyone from January 15,” it added.
                    Citizens will alternatively be able to give their views in local committees, since only 45 percent
                    of Tunisian homes are
                    connected to the Internet.Critics have said the move underlines the “populist” approach of the
                    president, who won
                    elections in 2019 with a landslide 73 percent of votes.
                    Saied’s one-man crusade to rebuild Tunisia’s broken political structures has sparked accusations
                    that he is establishing
                    a new autocracy in the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings.
                    Rights groups have pointed to military trials of opposition figures on charges such as “insulting
                    the president.”
                    A senior official of Islamist-inspired Ennahdha — one of the country’s main political parties — was
                    arrested by
                    plainclothes officers on Friday.
                    The party decried Noureddine Bhiri’s arrest as “a kidnapping and dangerous precedent marking the
                    country’s entry into a
                    tunnel to dictatorship.”

                Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border on Saturday in a second day of
                hostilities after the collapse of a truce in Gaza between Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
                Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a statement that one of its fighters was killed but did not specify when. Three people in
                south Lebanon were killed by Israeli shelling on Friday in south Lebanon, according to Lebanon's state news agency.
                Hezbollah said two of the dead were its fighters, Reuters reported.
                Hezbollah also said it fired rockets at an Israeli position.<span class="moreText"> Israel's military said two mortar bombs launched from
                Lebanon
                fell in open areas in Shomera, across the border from the south Lebanon village of Marwahin. The military said it
                responded by attacking the launch site and elsewhere in south Lebanon.
                Earlier on Saturday, shelling from Israel hit close to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) headquarters
                near the coastal town of Naqoura and around the border village of Rmaych, a UNIFIL spokesperson said.The Israeli
                military said it carried out shelling near Naqoura after spotting "unusual activity" in the area.
                UNIFIL also detected fire around 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) from the area of Tayr Harfa, about a mile from the Israeli frontier,
                toward Israel, the spokesperson said.
                Following the eruption of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah mounted near-daily rocket attacks on Israeli
                positions at the frontier while Israel waged air and artillery strikes in south Lebanon. But the border was largely calm
                during the week-long truce in the Gaza war.
                It has been the worst fighting since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.
                Just over 100 people in Lebanon have been killed during the hostilities, 83 of them Hezbollah fighters. Tens of
                thousands
                of people have fled both sides of the border.

                <div class="post_title">
                President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi announced a series of measures on Saturday to alleviate the financial strains on
                citizens, including raising the minimum wage for public sector employees from EGP 3,500 to EGP 4,000.
                El-Sisi raised the exceptional cost of living allowance to EGP 600, up from EGP 300, for all employees within the state
                administrative apparatus, economic entities, state-owned enterprises, and the public sector.
                The president also raised the annual income tax exemption threshold by 25 percent from EGP 36,000 to EGP 45,000 for all
                state employees.
                El-Sisi announced the new measures while inaugurating via video conference several development projects in the Beni Suef
                governorate as part of the Decent Life initiative.
                In addition, he raised Takaful and Karama benefits for its five million households by 15 percent and doubled the
                exceptional grant for 11 million pensioners and beneficiaries to EGP 600 from EGP 300.
                The minimum wage for government employees was last raised in March 2023 from EGP 3,000 to EGP 3,500.
                The president also directed an increase in technology allowances for journalists registered with the syndicate, in
                accordance with the provisions in the general budget.<span class="moreText">
                He directed the Egyptian Agricultural Bank to ease the burden on small farmers and individuals who were unable to pay
                interest on their loans prior to 1 January 2022.
                The president also announced that those who acquired land from the General Authority for Urban and Rural Development
                Projects and have been unable to pay interest and late penalty payments would be exempted from doing so, with a deadline
                by the end of 2024.
                Remembering Daniel victims

                El-Sisi presented his condolences to the families of Storm Daniel’s victims from the governorate.
                He asked the citizens attending the event to observe a minute of silence in memory of storm victims in Libya.
                At least 250 Egyptian migrants died in Derna alone due to Storm Daniel, according to estimates from the International
                Organization of Migration (IOM).
                On Tuesday, Libyan authorities handed Egypt over 185 dead bodies of Egyptians found across eastern Libya.
                On Wednesday, 75 of the deceased, mostly from El-Sherif village, were buried during a mass funeral in Beni Suef.
                Work is still underway to determine the total number of Egyptian victims, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
                Food security
                
                The president said supply chain disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the current shortage in dollars have
                raised the cost of food imports.
                He said the government is directing large sums of dollars to import millions of wheat in order to ensure that citizens
                can find enough bread.
                The president noted that he is aware of the circumstances faced by the people, expressing his appreciation to the
                citizens for bearing such difficulties.
                "But we are leaving no stone unturned to solve problems," he stressed.
                The state is racing to reclaim five million new feddans in the coming two to three years to produce necessary crops in a
                very short period, noted the president.
                These projects, which will create new jobs and produce more food, aim to lower our dependence on imports.
                Impact of Dollar Crisis
                
                The state is spending billions of dollars more to import oil needed to produce electricity amid rising global prices,
                El-Sisi noted.
                "Every dollar increase in the price of an oil barrel has an enormous annual cost on us tantamount to billions of
                dollars," he noted.
                The country's electrical power plants can produce more than enough electricity but the price of a barrel of diesel
                needed to operate them jumped from $65-$70 to $90, added the president.
                He concluded that the country faces no shortages in gas or diesel needed for vehicles despite these challenges.
