                <h3>Arab Economies Expected to Grow by 3.4% in 2023</h3>
                <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image25.png" alt=" ">
                <div class="post_title">
                    The Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) projected a 3.4 percent growth for Arab economies, accompanied by
                    tighter monetary
                    policies to curb inflation.
                    The report showed that Arab countries with economic reform programs and strategies to diversify
                    their economies,
                    improve their resilience, enhance their business environments, empower the private sector, and
                    invest in human capital
                    are
                    more able to cope with economic shocks.
                    The economic growth rate of Arab countries will rise to 4 percent in 2024, mainly due to the
                    expected stability of oil
                    and
                    gas prices, basic goods prices, and controlled inflation.
                    Higher energy prices will boost the economic growth of major Arab oil exporters in 2023 and 2024,
                    with their economies
                    expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2023 and by 4.2 percent in 2024, the report stated.
                    Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have a positive outlook for 2023, with an expected GDP
                    growth of 3.4
                    percent, mainly due to their efforts to diversify their sources of income, the report added, noting
                    that oil prices are
                    likely
                    to remain stable and high, resulting in higher oil revenues and improved financial outcomes, foreign
                    exchange reserves
                    and fiscal positions.
                    The report stressed that promoting workforce localization and increasing the participation of
                    citizens in the private
                    sector
                    is another key approach to achieving growth in GCC countries, most notably in the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
                    and Bahrain.
                    According to the AMF report, Arab countries that import oil will see their growth rate increase from
                    3.1 percent in 2023
                    to 4 percent in 2024, after inflation is controlled by the end of this year and monetary policies
                    are eased.
                    Various international organizations had different estimates for global economic growth in 2023 and
                    2024, ranging from
                    1.7 percent to 2.9 percent for 2023 and from 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent for 2024, the report stated.
                    Director General and Chairman of the Board of the Arab Monetary Fund. Dr. Abdulrahman Al Hamidy said
                    the region
                    has been witnessing a remarkable transition in the past years.
                    Saudi Arabia
                    The AMF expected Saudi Arabia's economic growth to remain robust in 2023-2024, reaching 3.1 percent
                    and 5.7 percent
                    respectively.
                    The non-oil sector in the Kingdom is forecast to achieve strong growth averages.
                    Even as the Kingdom aims to reduce its reliance on energy to develop the economy, its pioneering
                    role in the global oil
                    markets can’t be disregarded, the report added.
                    Saudi Arabia achieved an 8.7 percent GDP growth rate in 2022 and broke its total amount record of
                    more than $1 trillion.
                    A considerable part of this growth is attributed to the massive reforms carried out by the Kingdom
                    and structural
                    improvements that contributed to supporting the economy’s diversity, sustainable development in the
                    non-oil sector, and
                    maintaining a balanced public debt, in addition to reinforcing the financial and tourism sectors’
                    role within the Saudi
                    Vision 2030.UAE
                    The UAE's economic growth is expected to remain robust, averaging 4.6 percent from 2022 to 2024,
                    driven by higher oil
                    prices and improved business confidence, according to the AMF.
                    It forecasts a 4.2 percent growth rate for the UAE in 2023, accompanied by a decline in the consumer
                    price index to 2.9
                    percent in 2023 and 2.57 percent in 2024.
                    Egypt
                    The Egyptian economy is expected to achieve a 3.7 percent growth in 2023 down from 6.6 percent in
                    2022.
                    This drop is attributed to the global economic condition and the uncertainty resulting from the
                    global geopolitical and
                    economic changes, in addition to increased inflation that impacts business and individuals’
                    purchasing power.

                <h3>UAE's Masdar to Develop 150 MW Solar Project in Angola</h3>
                <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image28.png" alt=" ">
                <div class="post_title">
                    Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, known as Masdar, is planning to develop a 150-megawatt solar power
                    project in
                    Angola to provide renewable energy to 90,000 homes and support economic growth, including jobs, the
                    UAE state news
                    agency WAM said on Saturday.
                    The announcement was made during the COP28 climate summit hosted by the United Arab Emirates.
                    Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water and Masdar, the Gulf state's clean energy developer, signed a
                    concession
                    agreement to build and operate the ground-mounted solar power project in the Quipungo region of
                    southern Angola, the
                    statement said.
                    No details on the likely costs were provided. The project is part of a wider commitment made by
                    Masdar this year to
                    develop 5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects across Angola, Uganda and Zambia.
                    "Africa has what it takes to become the world’s renewable energy powerhouse," Sultan Al Jaber, COP28
                    president, said in
                    the statement.
                    "The UAE stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our friends in Africa as we strive to secure a just energy
                    transition at this
                    COP of action and COP for all."
                    Angola wants to increase its national electrification to around 60% by 2025; less than half of the
                    population has access
                    to
                    electricity at present, the statement said.

                <div class="post_title">
                The UAE said on Saturday it had concluded the terms of a trade deal with Colombia, which it called the first such
                bilateral
                agreement between the Gulf and South America.
                "The UAE and Colombia have concluded the terms of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement – the first
                bilateral trade deal between the Gulf and South America," Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE minister of State for Foreign Trade,
                wrote on X.
                "We can look ahead to a new era of cooperation that will deliver growth for both nations."
                UAE state news agency WAM said the deal, once implemented, will "remove or reduce tariffs on the majority of product
                lines, eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade, improve market access and deepen collaboration" across a variety of
                sectors,
