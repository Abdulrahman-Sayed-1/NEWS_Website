        <h3>Arab Economies Expected to Grow by 3.4% in 2023</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image25.png" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
          The Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) projected a 3.4 percent growth for Arab economies, accompanied by
          tighter monetary
          policies to curb inflation.
          The report showed that Arab countries with economic reform programs and strategies to diversify
          their economies,
          improve their resilience, enhance their business environments, empower the private sector, and
          invest in human capital
          are
          more able to cope with economic shocks.
          The economic growth rate of Arab countries will rise to 4 percent in 2024, mainly due to the
          expected stability of oil
          and
          gas prices, basic goods prices, and controlled inflation.
          <span class="moreText">Higher energy prices will boost the economic growth of major Arab oil exporters in 2023
            and 2024,
            with their economies
            expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2023 and by 4.2 percent in 2024, the report stated.
            Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have a positive outlook for 2023, with an expected GDP
            growth of 3.4
            percent, mainly due to their efforts to diversify their sources of income, the report added, noting
            that oil prices are
            likely
            to remain stable and high, resulting in higher oil revenues and improved financial outcomes, foreign
            exchange reserves
            and fiscal positions.
            The report stressed that promoting workforce localization and increasing the participation of
            citizens in the private
            sector
            is another key approach to achieving growth in GCC countries, most notably in the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
            and Bahrain.
            According to the AMF report, Arab countries that import oil will see their growth rate increase from
            3.1 percent in 2023
            to 4 percent in 2024, after inflation is controlled by the end of this year and monetary policies
            are eased.
            Various international organizations had different estimates for global economic growth in 2023 and
            2024, ranging from
            1.7 percent to 2.9 percent for 2023 and from 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent for 2024, the report stated.
            Director General and Chairman of the Board of the Arab Monetary Fund. Dr. Abdulrahman Al Hamidy said
            the region
            has been witnessing a remarkable transition in the past years.
            Saudi Arabia
            The AMF expected Saudi Arabia's economic growth to remain robust in 2023-2024, reaching 3.1 percent
            and 5.7 percent
            respectively.
            The non-oil sector in the Kingdom is forecast to achieve strong growth averages.
            Even as the Kingdom aims to reduce its reliance on energy to develop the economy, its pioneering
            role in the global oil
            markets can’t be disregarded, the report added.
            Saudi Arabia achieved an 8.7 percent GDP growth rate in 2022 and broke its total amount record of
            more than $1 trillion.
            A considerable part of this growth is attributed to the massive reforms carried out by the Kingdom
            and structural
            improvements that contributed to supporting the economy’s diversity, sustainable development in the
            non-oil sector, and
            maintaining a balanced public debt, in addition to reinforcing the financial and tourism sectors’
            role within the Saudi
            Vision 2030.UAE
            The UAE's economic growth is expected to remain robust, averaging 4.6 percent from 2022 to 2024,
            driven by higher oil
            prices and improved business confidence, according to the AMF.
            It forecasts a 4.2 percent growth rate for the UAE in 2023, accompanied by a decline in the consumer
            price index to 2.9
            percent in 2023 and 2.57 percent in 2024.
            Egypt
            The Egyptian economy is expected to achieve a 3.7 percent growth in 2023 down from 6.6 percent in
            2022.
            This drop is attributed to the global economic condition and the uncertainty resulting from the
            global geopolitical and
            economic changes, in addition to increased inflation that impacts business and individuals’
            purchasing power.

        <h3>UAE's Masdar to Develop 150 MW Solar Project in Angola</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image28.png" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
          Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, known as Masdar, is planning to develop a 150-megawatt solar power
          project in
          Angola to provide renewable energy to 90,000 homes and support economic growth, including jobs, the
          UAE state news
          agency WAM said on Saturday.
          The announcement was made during the COP28 climate summit hosted by the United Arab Emirates.
          Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water and Masdar, the Gulf state's clean energy developer, signed a
          concession
          agreement to build and operate the ground-mounted solar power project in the Quipungo region of
          southern Angola, the
          statement said. <span class="moreText">
            No details on the likely costs were provided. The project is part of a wider commitment made by
            Masdar this year to
            develop 5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects across Angola, Uganda and Zambia.
            "Africa has what it takes to become the world’s renewable energy powerhouse," Sultan Al Jaber, COP28
            president, said in
            the statement.
            "The UAE stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our friends in Africa as we strive to secure a just energy
            transition at this
            COP of action and COP for all."
            Angola wants to increase its national electrification to around 60% by 2025; less than half of the
            population has access
            to
            electricity at present, the statement said.

        <div class="post_title">
          The UAE said on Saturday it had concluded the terms of a trade deal with Colombia, which it called the first
          such
          bilateral
          agreement between the Gulf and South America.
          "The UAE and Colombia have concluded the terms of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement – the first
          bilateral trade deal between the Gulf and South America," Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE minister of State for Foreign
          Trade,
          wrote on X.
            "We can look ahead to a new era of cooperation that will deliver growth for both nations."
            UAE state news agency WAM said the deal, once implemented, will "remove or reduce tariffs on the majority of
            product
            lines, eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade, improve market access and deepen collaboration" across a
            variety of

        <h3>Saudi Arabia’s non-oil activities increase by 3.5% in Q3: GASTAT</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image14.jpg" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
          RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s non-oil activities increased by 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2023, compared to
          the same period of the previous year, as the Kingdom steadily diversifies its economy away from oil, official
          data showed.
          According to a report released by the General Authority for Statistics, the Kingdom’s non-activities also rose
          by 0.4 percent in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter of this year.
          Strengthening the non-oil private sector is crucial for Saudi Arabia, aligning with the goals outlined in
          Vision
          2030 as the Kingdom continues to diversify its economy.
          However, the report noted that Saudi Arabia’s real gross domestic product decreased by 4.4 percent yearon-year
          in the
          third quarter, and by 3.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
          This decline is attributed to a 17 percent decrease in oil activities during the third quarter, following the
          Kingdom’s decision, in alignment with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to reduce oil
          output.<span class="moreText">
          The commitment to a 500,000 barrels per day output cut, initiated in April and extended until December
          2024, contributed to this reduction.
          Additionally, Saudi Arabia pledged an extra 1 million bpd cut in July, with the Ministry of Energy announcing
          in November that this supplementary cut would continue until the end of December 2023.
          The GASTAT report indicated that government activities, the second-highest contributor to real GDP at 15.3
          percent, grew by 1.9 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.
          However, government activities experienced a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter compared to the
          second quarter of this year.
          Furthermore, the report noted positive growth rates in most economic activities during the third
          quarter.Community,
          social, and personal services activities grew by 11.8 percent year-on-year, while finance,
          insurance, and business services increased by 6.2 percent.
          Wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, and hotel activities also rose by 5.4 percent during the same period.

        <h3>COP28 launches charity anthem featuring 13 global artists</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image16.jpg" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
          “Lasting Legacy,” the official charity anthem of COP28, the United Nations Climate Conference hosted in the
          UAE, was launched and performed live for the first time during the closing session of the World Climate
          Action Summit in Dubai on Dec. 2.
          The performance, which featured various talents and renowned artists from around the world, served as a
          one-of-a-kind call to action to accelerate the global response to climate change and environmental
          degradation.
          The diverse voices and musical cultures included in the song, produced by Moroccan multi-Grammy Award
          winner RedOne, serve as a reminder of the strength of unity and international cooperation in the face of the
          climate crisis.
          Underscoring an inclusive spirit, the anthem embraces the six official languages of the United Nations:
          Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Other languages on the anthem include Hindi,
          Bahasa, Vietnamese, and Portuguese. This linguistic diversity symbolizes a commitment to universal
          communication and understanding, essential in fostering global cooperation and unity in the fight against
          climate change.
          Badr Jafar, COP28 special representative for business and philanthropy, and executive producer of the
          anthem said: “UAE’s hosting of COP28 has been an important milestone in the global effort to rally decisive
          action in support of our climate and nature goals. The release of this charity anthem, ‘Lasting Legacy,’ is
          intended to deliver a message of hope and unity in this mission, raise much-needed funds for climateadaptation
          for
          crisis-affected communities, and inspire wider engagement in the climate action agenda from
          people of all ages and cultures.”<span class="moreText">
          RedOne added: “Music has the power to transcend boundaries, and this anthem is a beacon of hope and a
          reminder that together, in harmony, we can make a significant impact in the fight against climate change.”
          The anthem features a great roster of musicians, each of whom has infused the song with elements from
          their respective languages and cultures, including: Saudi Arabia’s Dalia Mubarak; Balqees from the UAE;
          Gims from the Congo and France; Mo Agnez from Indonesia; India’s Anushka Sen; Arrow Bwoy from Kenya;
          Inna Modja from Mali; Boy Story from China; Valeriya from Russia; Van Mai Huong from Vietnam; AY Young
          from the US; Barbara Doza from Venezuela; Carolina Doche from the US and Brazil.
          Producer Taymoor Marmarchi said: “As the global community converged for COP28, ‘Lasting Legacy’
          emerged as a profound musical embodiment of this pivotal summit. The anthem reflects the UAE’s deeprooted
          commitment to
          environmental stewardship and stands as a powerful reminder that together, we can
          forge a path toward a more sustainable and resilient future.”
          Khaled Khalifa, UNHCR senior adviser and GCC representative, emphasized the pressing need to address the
          climate crisis and added: “I am grateful to the organizers and participating artists for their invaluable
          contributions to this initiative. I sincerely hope their work will not only spread awareness but also inspire
          individuals everywhere to believe in their capacity to effect positive change in the world.”
          Karl Shuker, director of international philanthropy and partnerships for the MENA region at the International
          Rescue Committee, said: “Communities where the IRC works, those living at the sharp end of the climate
          crisis, need our support more than ever before. We are proud to dedicate the proceeds raised to the
          tangible, innovative climate adaptation solutions that the international community must rally around today
          to support those in need.”
          ‘Lasting Legacy’ is available on all streaming platforms. All proceeds from the record will support climate
          adaptation for vulnerable communities around the world through the work of the IRC and the UNHCR.

        <h3>African Development Bank lends Tunisia funds for wastewater reuse in agriculture</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image34.jpg" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
          To be implemented over the period 2024-2028, the project will improve the treatment of wastewater to make it
          compliant
          with the standards for its reuse
          unisia - The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group approved a loan of €81.9 million to
          Tunisia to
          implement the Treated Wastewater Quality Improvement Project For Climate Resilience Building (PAQEE-RCC) at a
          meeting in
          Abidjan on 6 December.
          To be implemented over the period 2024-2028, the project will improve the treatment of wastewater to make it
          compliant
          with the standards for its reuse. It will improve treatment and energy performance through the renewal of
          electromechanical and electrical equipment and the use of photovoltaic solar energy in 19 water treatment
          plants across
          11 of the country's governorates. It will also contribute to improving the water balance, to building
          resilience to
          climate change and to improving the quality of life for more than 670,000 people.<span class="moreText">
          "This project is an important example of the water-energy-agriculture nexus by upgrading treated wastewater
          for
          agriculture and reducing energy costs by using solar energy," said Malinne Blomberg, Deputy Director-General
          of the
          African Development Bank for the North Africa Region.
          "By using a non-conventional and non-weather dependent resource, this project will make an active contribution
          to food
          security (increased production of olives, dates and other fruit, and forage to increase animal, dairy and meat
          production) against a background of drought and scarcity of water resources, and food product price inflation
          on the
          international market," explained Belgacem Ben Sassi, the African Development Bank's regional coordinator for
          water and
          sanitation.
          More than 3,000 hectares of agricultural land around the water treatment plants involved will be sown using
          the treated
          water. The project will create approximately 200 direct temporary jobs (including 20% for women), 50 direct
          permanent
          jobs (including 30% for women) and 1,000 indirect jobs, 35% of which will be for women.
          This new funding is the Bank's third operation in the urban sanitation subsector to the benefit of Tunisia's
          National
          Sanitation Office (ONAS). It brings the total amount of commitments in the drinking water and sanitation
          sector to more
          than €400 million since 2011. All these operations have helped to improve access for people, especially those
          in
          disadvantaged regions, to drinking water and sanitation services, while promoting the reuse of purified
          wastewater,
          particularly in agriculture

        <h3>Oman-Singapore travel connectivity looks to grow with increasing demand</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image46.jpeg" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
        The countries have historical ties dating back to Omani merchants and sailors arriving at the ancient port of Singapore
        via wooden dhows
        The aerial distance between Muscat International Airport (MCT) in Oman and Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) spans
        approximately 6,267 kilometres.
        It is not a new destination for travellers from Oman as in the past. Omani merchants and sailors had arrived in
        Singapore’s ancient port with wooden dhows. It is 5,000 kilometres by sea, as the wooden ship Jewel of Muscat proved it
        in 2010.
        The countries have historical ties dating back to Omani merchants and sailors arriving at the ancient port of Singapore
        via wooden dhows. The maritime connection between Oman and Singapore, reminiscent of the Silk Road, saw a revival in the
        second century, and the Sultanate of Oman in the present millennium not only resurrected maritime routes but also
        showcased indigenous boat-building skills through the remarkable nail-less dhow, Jewel of Muscat.
        Muscat Street, a symbolic reminder of the historical ties between Oman and Singapore, echoes bustling trade from the
        1800s to the early 1900s. In the Kampong Glam area, Muscat Street has been adorned with arches, wall paintings, and
        aesthetic touches inspired by Oman’s rich maritime heritage.
        While Omani passport holders enjoy a visa-free short-term stay of 30 days in Singapore, Singaporean passport holders
        visiting Oman can stay for up to 14 days for tourism purposes, provided they have confirmed hotel reservations and
        return tickets.<span class="moreText">
        Singapore stands out globally as a finance, technology, and medical tourism hub, ranking second in the medical tourism
        index. Conversely, Oman, with tourism as a key diversification pillar, invites visitors to experience its unique blend
        of culture, environment, heritage, and renowned hospitality.
        Tourist flows from Oman to Singapore experienced a notable dip in 2009 but rebounded strongly in 2010, with consistent
        growth until stabilisation in 2013-2015. Subsequently, there was a significant surge in 2016, and since then, the trend
        has been steady growth.
        Recent data from September 2023 reveals 828,315 visitors to Singapore, compared to 1,056,102 the previous month. While
        this represents a decline, Singapore has historically seen fluctuations, with a record high of 1,397,737 in August 2019
        and a low of 1,732 in September 2020.
        Beyond tourism, the collaboration between Oman and Singapore extends to education, training, and qualification
        programmes, marked by numerous agreements and memoranda of understanding. Singapore’s prestigious health institutions
        have actively offered fellowship programmes to Omani doctors.
        Moreover, scholarships such as the Royal Society International Exchange Programme and NUS President’s Graduate
        Fellowship are available for Omani students in Singapore. This educational exchange strengthens the bonds between the
        two nations.
        Given these historical ties, growing tourism, and deepening cooperation, the question arises: Should there be more
        flights and direct airline connections between Muscat and Singapore? The answer lies in the increasing demand. As
        bilateral relations continue to flourish, enhancing air connectivity will boost tourism and facilitate more seamless
        collaboration and cultural exchange between these two nations.

        <h3>Central Bank of Egypt sells $990 mln USD-dominated T-bills</h3>
        <img class="post_img" src="..\images file\image18.jpg" alt=" ">
        <div class="post_title">
        The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) sold on Monday $990 million in USD-denominated treasury bills (T-bills) with
        a one-year maturity, according to the bank’s website
        The issuance received high demand from investors, covering 110.1 percent of the issuance value, which sent
        a positive message of trust in the CBE’s securities.
        The CBE sold the USD T-bills at an average yield of 5.15 percent.
        “The CBE usually issues six US-denominated issuances yearly to cover the budget deficit. These issuances are
        attractive and offer low risk to investors and their yields are typically low,” banking expert Mohamed El-Beih
        told Ahram Online.
        “USD T-bills are used to cover the foreign currency shortage and pay the debt service,” El-Beih added.
        The average yield of one-year securities reached 5.1 percent on 4 December, according to the US
        Department of the Treasury.
        The CBE has been taking various steps to increase its international reserve, amid a shortage in foreign
        currency that caused a discrepancy between official and parallel exchange rates of local currency.<span class="moreText">
        The Egyptian government, in turn, announced a plan to collect $191 billion through 2026 by gradually
        expanding its initial public offering (IPO) program and introducing additional incentives for foreign investors,
        such as tax exemptions and golden licenses.
        In November, the CBE auctioned $1.61 billion USD-denominated T-bills, the bank’s highest USD debt
        instruments offering (treasury bills and bonds) since mid-2020.
        The bank issued €645 million in T-bills in November, after a €600 million issuance in August.
        The CBE usually issues T-bills on behalf of the Ministry of Finance to finance the budget deficit.
        Egypt’s budget deficit rose to 3.85 percent of GDP during the first quarter (July-September) of FY2023/2024,
        up from 2.05 percent in the corresponding quarter in FY2022/2023.
        Despite the acute shortage in the USD, the country should pay $29.23 billion in external debt service in 2024,
        $19.43 billion in 2025, and $22.94 billion in 2026.
        The country is under review for a $3 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The
        review has been delayed multiple times, with no final date set yet.
